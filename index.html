    <h1>               Expecation vs Reality of College</h1>
    <p>College gives us so many memories and achievements in our life specailly in B.tech where we get much things to learn either academic or skill development.
        But when our mind creates a image of our college before getting into campus, such things happened with me also. So I would like to share my review on "Expectaion VS Reality" for my college.

    <h1> COURSE</h1>
    <h2><em>Expectation</em></h2>
    <p>It was expected that the course will not be too much heptic and we will be getting enough time to explore our surroundings </p>
    
    <h2><em>Reality</em></h2>
    <p>Actually, we study many subjects other than Computer Programming like Electronics, Professional Communication, Electical Technology and Engineering Physics also in some sections for the first year, we also have to do lot of assignments in different subjects.</p>
    
    <h1>ROOM SIZE</h1>
    
    <h2><em>Expectation</em></h2>
    <p>We thought that as usual like other hostels we would be soffacting with 3 or 4 students in a single room with low space but we suppoesed that we would be getting almirah for stroring our clothes.
        Also it was supposed that we have to clean our rooms particularly.
    </p>
    
    <h2><em>Reality</em></h2>
    <p>It was good to know after coming her that only 2 students will be here in a single room and rooms will be cleaned by 2nd or 3rd day by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housekeeper_(domestic_worker)">housekeepers</a>. Also we got quite space in our rooms but here is no almirah.
    </p>
     
    <h1>FACULTIES</h1>

    <h2><em>Expectation</em></h2>
    <p>We thought as like other colleges our faculties will be so strict and not such co-operative. We imagined something like it would be tougher side for us to cope up with them in studies. </p>
     
    <h2><em>Reality</em></h2>
    <p> But in reality situations are different, faculties are so much helpful. They just not clear our doubts also they themselves teaches us in such an effective manner that our most of doubts could be clear easily. </p>

    <h1>WIFI SPEED</h1>
    <h2><em>Expectation</em></h2>
    <P>I thought that the wifi internet speed would be good enough to handle the workloads as well as our personal needs related to music and gaming as well as movies in weekends. </P>

    <h2><em>Reality</em></h2>
    <p>Wifi speed is not that bad but it sometimes not capable to handle 8 persons internet needs at a time and also watching youtube videos <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/buffer">buffers</a> usually and gaming with this internet speed is nearly impossible. </p>
     
    <h1>GENDER RATIO</h1>
    <h2><em>Expectation</em></h2>
    <p>I got to know from youtube that the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/gender-ratio#:~:text=The%20sex%20ratio%20at%20birth%20is%20not%20equal%3A%20in%20every,around%20103%20to%20107%20boys).">gender ratio</a> for Boys to Girls is 1:5 </p>
    <h><em>After getting admission here I realized that the reality was totaly differenet and Boys to Girls ratio is 1:22</em></h>

    <h1>CURFEW TIME</h1>
    <h2><em><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/curfew">Curfew</a> time is that which was expected, for campus gate it is 9 PM and for Hostel Building it is 10 PM</em></h2>

    <h1>ABOUT PLACEMENTS</h1>
    <p>The good thing about college is that it is one of the fastest growing colleges which had setup its Brand Values and Average <a href="https://www.collegedekho.com/articles/top-btech-colleges-with-100-percent-placements/">Placement</a> Package is getting increased every consecutive year with the highest package also.</p>
